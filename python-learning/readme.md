## Python üêç
##### Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.

### Python Inner Working
- Python is an interpreted language, meaning it runs line by line.
- Python is an object-oriented language, meaning it treats everything as an object.
- Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don't have to declare the type of variable.

#### Byte Code
- Python code is first compiled into byte code.
- Byte code is a low-level platform-independent representation of your source code.
- Byte code is stored in `.pyc` files.
- Byte code is executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).

#### Python Virtual Machine (PVM)
- PVM is an interpreter that reads and executes Python byte code.
- PVM is a stack-based machine, meaning it uses a stack to store data.
- PVM is written in C.
- Different Python interpreters use different PVMs.

#### Python Interpreter
- Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code.
- Python interpreter is written in C.
- Python interpreter is a command-line program.
- Different Python interpreters are available, such as CPython, Jython, IronPython, PyPy, etc.

### Python Comments
- Single Line Comment: `# This is a single line comment`
- Multi Line Comment: `''' This is a multi line comment '''`

### Python Variables
- Variables are used to store data.
- example: `x = 5`
- Variables are case-sensitive.
- Variables can start with a letter or underscore.
- Object is a block of memory that contains data and information on how to process that data. it is an instance of a class. it can be a number, string, list, etc.
- Variables store the memory location of an object are called references. and the object is stored in memory.


### Python Data Types
- Python has several data types, such as int, float, complex, str, list, tuple, dict, set, bool, etc.
- Use `type()` function to get the data type of a variable.
- example: `x = 5`, `print(type(x))` will output `<class 'int'>`

#### Table of Data Types
| Data Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| int | Integer | x = 5 |
| float | Floating Point Number | x = 5.5 |
| complex | Complex Number | x = 5 + 5j |
| str | String | x = 'Hello' |
| list | List | x = [1, 2, 3] |
| tuple | Tuple | x = (1, 2, 3) |
| dict | Dictionary | x = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25} |
| set | Set | x = {1, 2, 3} |
| bool | Boolean | x = True |

#### Mutable vs Immutable Data Types
- Mutable in Python means that the object can be changed after it is created. Example: list, dict, set.
- Immutable in Python means that the object cannot be changed after it is created. In other words, if you change the value of an object, then the variable will point to a new memory location and the old memory location will be deleted by the garbage collector. example: int, float, complex, str, tuple, bool.

#### Example How Mutable and Immutable Data Types Work
```python
x = 5
print(id(x)) # 140732674000192
x = 6
print(id(x)) # 140732674000224
```
- In the above example, the memory location of x changes when the value of x changes. This is because int is an immutable data type.

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
print(id(x)) # 140732674000192
x.append(4)
print(id(x)) # 140732674000192
```
- In the above example, the memory location of x does not change when the value of x changes. This is because list is a mutable data type.

#### Example How memory location works in Python
```python
x = 5
y = x
print(id(x)) # 140732674000192
print(id(y)) # 140732674000192
x = 6
print(id(x)) # 140732674000224
print(id(y)) # 140732674000192
```
- In the above example, the memory location of x and y are the same when x is assigned to y. But when the value of x changes, the memory location of x changes but the memory location of y remains the same.

### Python Operators

### Python Booleans
- Booleans are used to represent the truth values False and True.
- Booleans are immutable data types.
- Booleans are used in conditional statements.
- example: `x = True`, `y = False`
- Use `and` operator to return True if both statements are true. eg. `5 > 3 and 5 < 10` will output `True`
- Use `or` operator to return True if one of the statements is true. eg. `5 > 3 or 5 < 3` will output `True`
- Use `not` operator to reverse the result. eg. `not(5 > 3)` will output `False`

### Python Indentation
- Indentation is used to define a block of code.
- Indentation is used in loops, functions, classes, etc.
- Indentation is used to make the code more readable.
- Most programming languages use curly braces `{}` to define a block of code, but Python uses indentation.
- If not properly indented, Python will raise an `IndentationError`.
- example:
```python
if 5 > 3:
print('5 is greater than 3') # IndentationError
```
```python
if 5 > 3:
    print('5 is greater than 3') # No Error
```



### Python If...Else
- If...Else statements are used to make decisions in Python.
- If...Else statements are used in conditional statements.
- example:
```python
x = 5
if x > 3:
    print('x is greater than 3')
else:
    print('x is less than or equal to 3')
```

### Python Elif
- Elif is short for Else If.
- Elif statements are used to make multiple decisions in Python.
- Elif statements are used in conditional statements.
- example:
```python
x = 5
if x > 3:
    print('x is greater than 3')
elif x < 3:
    print('x is less than 3')
else:
    print('x is equal to 3')
```

### Python Loops
- Loops are used to iterate over a sequence or a block of code multiple times.
- Python has two types of loops, such as `for` loop and `while` loop.

#### Python For Loop
- For loop is used to iterate over a sequence or a block of code multiple times.
- For loop is used in conditional statements.
- example:
```python
for x in range(5): # range(5) will generate numbers from 0 to 4
    print(x)
```
more examples:
```python
for x in range(1, 5): # range(1, 5) will generate numbers from 1 to 4
    print(x)
```
```python
for x in range(1, 10, 2): # range(1, 10, 2) will generate numbers from 1 to 9 with a step of 2
    print(x)
```
```python
for x in 'Hello': # iterate over a string
    print(x) # H e l l o line by line
```
```python
for x in ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']: # iterate over a list
    print(x) # apple banana cherry line by line
```
```python
for x in ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry'): # iterate over a tuple
    print(x) # apple banana cherry line by line
```
```python
for x in {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}: # iterate over a dictionary
    print(x) # name age line by line
```

#### Python While Loop
- While loop is used to iterate over a sequence or a block of code multiple times.
- While loop is used in conditional statements.
- example:
```python
x = 0
while x < 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1
```
more examples:
- Use `break` statement to stop the loop before it has looped through all the items.
```python
x = 0
while x < 5:
    print(x)
    if x == 3:
        break # break the loop if x is equal to 3
    x += 1
```
- Use `continue` statement to skip the current iteration and continue with the next iteration.
```python
x = 0
while x < 5:
    x += 1
    if x == 3:
        continue # skip the iteration if x is equal to 3
    print(x)
```

### Python Functions
- Functions are used to perform a specific task.
- Functions are used to avoid code repetition.
- Functions are used to make the code more readable.
- Functions are used to make the code more organized.
- example:
```python
def my_function():
    print('Hello World!')
my_function() # Hello World!
```
more examples:
```python
def my_function(name):
    print('Hello ' + name)
my_function('John') # Hello John
```
```python
def my_function(name = 'John'):
    print('Hello ' + name)
my_function() # Hello John
```
```python
def my_function(*kids): # *args is used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function
    print('The youngest child is ' + kids[2]) # kids is a tuple
my_function('John', 'Jane', 'Jake') # The youngest child is Jake
```
```python
def my_function(**kid): # **kwargs is used to pass a keyworded, variable-length argument list to a function
    print('His last name is ' + kid['lname']) # kid is a dictionary
my_function(fname = 'John', lname = 'Doe') # His last name is Doe
```
